## Filesystem Backend
The filesystem backend simply works by reading json files from the filesystem. An instance of the `BE.FILE_BACKEND` has these 4 components:
- **Backend** : A directory in the filesystem. e.g `~/Configurations/`, When a new backend instance is created Confo takes a name parameter and internally creates a mapping 
 between the directory and the name parameter. The name does not necessarily need to be the same as the name of the directory.
- **Namespace** : A namespace is simply a subdirectory of the main directory e.g `~/Configurations/sales` where `sales/` is a directory. Unlike with the main directory Confo 
    uses the subdirectory's name to as the namespace name.
- **Configuration** : A configuration is a json file that is stored in one of the `namespace` directories, e.g `~/Configurations/sales/database.json`.
- **Field** : A field is simply a key/value pair stored in the json file, e.g `host`:`10.222.194.106` , `port`: `3306`. A field can have a value which is an object. e.g to store a list of 
   `admin email addresses` one can use `admins`: ["kabelo.masemola@sambe.co.za","bhavesh.lala@sambe.co.za"].

### The credentials dictionary
```python
from confo.Confo import Confo
import confo.Backends as BE

#create the singleton configuration manager object 
config = Confo()

# Instantiate a FILE_BACKEND backend 
cred = {"config_path":"Configurations/"}
config.load_backend(credentials=cred,name="name",backend_type=BE.FILE_BACKEND)

```
For  `BE.FILE_BACKEND` the credentials dictionary has the following properties:
- **config_path** : This is the location of the configuration directory.

### Usage

An example configuration can be setup like below. Imagine you have a sales database with credentials you want to expose to your application, and you want to use a sales forecasting model which is exposed via REST api.
Confo uses namespaces to separate logical groups of configurations. For example everything concerned with systems from the `sales` department can be stored in the
`sales` namespace and every configuration concerned with systems from the `anlytics team` can be store in a namespace called `analytics`.

```
mkdir Configurations
mkdir Configurations/sales
mkdir Configurations/analytics
echo '{"host":"127.0.0.1", "port":5432,"username":"kabelo","password":"confoRocks"}' > Configurations/sales/database.json
echo '{"host":"127.0.0.1", "port":5432,"token":"2df228d6-890b-11eb-8dcd-0242ac130003","secret":"d51a8a7a-3286-4deb-8805-85f4528920ae 
dcfb49c0-a251-4657-87df-44996ea308ee"}' > Configurations/analytics/api_one.json
```
In the setup above both namespaces only have one configuration,but each namespace can have infinite configurations. `Confo` uses a json files to store each configuration.
```
backend 
   |______namespace
             |_______configuration
                          |__________fields
                          
e.g

filesystem 
  |________sales
             |___________database 
                             |_________host : 127.0.0.1 
                             |_________port : 5432
                             |_________user : kabelo 
                             |_________password :confoRocks 
```

```python
from confo.Confo import Confo
import confo.Backends as BE

#create the singleton configuration manager object 
config = Confo()


```
The `Confo` object is a singleton, meaning you can instantiate it multiple time through the code base, but you will always have
up to date configurations loaded. 

```python
# Instantiate a FILE_BACKEND backend 
cred = {"config_path":"Configurations/"}
config.load_backend(credentials=cred,name="example_file_backend",backend_type=BE.FILE_BACKEND)


```

## Etcd Backend
The Etcd backend  uses <a href="https://etcd.io/" > Etcd</a> as a storage mechanism.
Etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be
accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections
during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node. `Confo` uses etcd as one of its backends allowing developers
to build modern applications in the distributed context with ease, Confo abstracts away the details of Etcd's API in favour for a robust consistent API.


Every instance of `BE.ETCD_BACKEND` has these 4 components:

- **Backend**: A etcd server connection. When a `BE.ETCD_BACKEND` instance is created a `confo` key is created automatically which holds this value `json {"namespaces":[]}`, so every Confo managed etcd cluster must have this `confo` KV pair.
- **Namespace**: In the etcd backend all namespaces are listed in the `confo` key; if we have a namespace called `HR_dept` it is stored in `confo` -> `json {"namespaces":["HR_dept"]}`, then a new key called `HR_dept` which holds this value `json {"configurations":[]}`. All keys that are listed in the `confo` key as namespaces they will be used to query the location of `configurations`
- **Configuration**: Every namespace key lists all its configurations. If you have a configuration called `database` in the `HR_dept` namespace , it is registered as: `HR_dept` -> `json {"configurations":["database"]}`,then a key called `HR_dept-database` is generated and holds a json representation of the database configurations.
- **Field** : A field is simply a key/value pair stored in the json object, e.g `host:127.0.0.1` , `port: 2181`. A field can have a value which is an object. e.g to store a list of `admin email addresses` one can use `admins`: `["karabo.maleka@sambeconsulting.com","kabelo.masemola@sambe.co.za"]`.

```python
 
 KEYS   =       confo                    ->    HR_dept                      -> HR_dept-database ->              e.g host 
 
 VALUES =     {"namespaces":["HR_dept"]} ->  {"configurations":["database"]}  -> {                           -> 127.0.0.1
                                                                                      "driver": "pgsql",
                                                                                      "host": "127.0.0.1",
                                                                                      "database": "portal",
                                                                                      "user": "gemuser",
                                                                                      "password": "gempass",
                                                                                      "prefix": ""
                                                                                    }
                                                                                    

```


### The credentials dictionary
```python

from confo.Confo import Confo
import confo.Backends as BE
#create the singleton configuration manager object 
config = Confo()
# Instantiate a ETCD_BACKEND backend 
cred = {"host":"127.0.0.1",  
        "port":"2181",
        #If you want to register pre- existing namespaces during backend loading 
        "namespaces":["HR_dept","sales"]
        }
config.load_backend(credentials=cred,name="ecommerce_configs",backend_type=BE.ETCD_BACKEND )


```

For  `BE.ETCD_BACKEND` the credentials dictionary has the following properties:

- **host** : The address of the etcd server
- **port** : The port of the etcd server.
- **namespace** : This property is optional and allows the registration of pre-existing namespaces.

**Note:**
You can use the  `BE.FILE_BACKEND` to store the credentials for etcd. Then use Confo itself to create the etcd backend.

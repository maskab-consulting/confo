## Etcd Backend
The Etcd backend  uses <a href="https://etcd.io/" > Etcd</a> as a storage mechanism.
Etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be
accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections
during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node. `Confo` uses etcd as one of its backends allowing developers
to build modern applications in the distributed context with ease, Confo abstracts away the details of Etcd's API in favour for a robust consistent API.


The etcd backend saves the configurations to etcd. Imagine you have a sales database with credentials you want to expose to your application, and you want to use a sales forecasting model which is exposed via REST api. `Confo` uses namespaces to separate logical groups of configurations. For example everything concerned with systems from the `sales` department can be stored in the `sales` namespace and every configuration concerned with systems from the `analytics` team can be store in a namespace called `analytics`.
An example of how configurations can be set and retrieved is shown below.

In order to use etcd, you must first import `confo` and create a singleton configuration object. You then define etcd credentials to connect to the etcd client.

```python
from confo.Confo import Confo
from confo import Backends as BE
from confo.Backends.EtcdBackend import EtcdBackend

# Create the singleton configuration manager object
config = Confo()
```

Create a new `Confo` object `config` and load the credentials of your ETCD Server. Provide a name for your backend.

```
# Instantiate a ETCD_BACKEND backend 
cred = {"host":"127.0.0.1",  
        "port":2379}
config.load_backend(credentials=cred,name="ETCD_backend",backend_type=BE.ETCD_BACKEND)
```


The `Confo.load_backend(credentials,name,backend_type)` method is used to create a backend management object.The credentials differ by backend type. The etcd backend accepts a dictionary of credentials `cred` to connect.

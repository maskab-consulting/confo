<h1> Introduction to Redis </h1>
<p> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#strings"> strings </a>, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#hashes"> hashes </a>, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#lists"> lists </a>, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#sets"> sets </a>, <a href="https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#sorted-sets"> sorted sets </a> with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.</p>
